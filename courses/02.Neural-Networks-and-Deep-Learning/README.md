Because I did not pay for the course, I am not able to submit my assignments and quiz. Therefore to know the assessment results, I compared the answers with [this repository](https://github.com/HeroKillerEver/coursera-deep-learning)
to check how many of my answers are correct.

Also [this repository](https://github.com/mbadry1/DeepLearning.ai-Summary/) is useful for looking up notes.
